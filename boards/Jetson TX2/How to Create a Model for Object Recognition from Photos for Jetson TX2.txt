This text assumes all the relevant software is already installed on the Jetson.

Prerequisites: Jetson TX2 flashed with JetPack 3.3.

Caffe version: 0.15.14

DIGITS version: 6.1.1

Check that all software is installed correctly by using the pre-installed dog detect model that comes with Jetpack by running this in terminal:

$ sudo ~/jetson_clocks.sh && cd jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin && ./detectnet-camera coco-dog
It will take a few minutes to load up before the camera footage appears.

To build models from scratch, turn on the DIGITS server:

$ sudo ~/jetson_clocks.sh && cd digits && export CAFFE_ROOT=/home/nvidia/caffe && ./digits-devserver
Now we're going to build the model using actual images of dogs with their associated text files:

Importing the Detection Dataset into DIGITS:

Training image folder:  /media/nvidia/2037-F6FA/coco/train/images/dog

Validation label folder: /media/nvidia/2037-F6FA/coco/val/labels/dog
Pad image (Width x Height): 640 x 640

Specifying the DetectNet Prototxt:
> Custom Network > Caffe
The DetectNet prototxt is located at /home/nvidia/jetson-inference/data/networks/detectnet.prototxt in the repo.

> Pretrained Model = /home/nvidia/jetson-inference/data/networks/bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel
>Create
Location of epoch snapshots: /home/nvidia/digits/digits/jobs
You should see the model being created through a series of epochs. Make a note of the final epoch.

Navigate to /home/nvidia/digits/digits/jobs and open the latest job folder and check it has the 'snapshot_iter_*****.caffemodel' files in it. Make a note of the highest '*****' number then copy and paste the folder into here for deployment: /home/nvidia/jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin.

Rename the folder to reflect the number of epochs that it passed, eg myDogModel_epoch_30.

For Jetson TX2, at the end of deploy.prototxt, delete the layer named cluster:

layer {
  name: "cluster"
  type: "Python"
  bottom: "coverage"
  bottom: "bboxes"
  top: "bbox-list"
  python_param {
    module: "caffe.layers.detectnet.clustering"
    layer: "ClusterDetections"
    param_str: "640, 640, 16, 0.6, 2, 0.02, 22, 1"
  }
}
Open terminal and run, changing the '*****' number accordingly:

$ cd jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin && NET=myDogModel_epoch_30 && ./detectnet-camera \
--prototxt=$NET/deploy.prototxt \
--model=$NET/snapshot_iter_*****.caffemodel \
Hit return twice and you'll see various messges including: 

[TRT]  attempting to open cache file dogPoo_epoch_8/snapshot_iter_3088.caffemodel.2.tensorcache
[TRT]  cache file not found, profiling network model

This is not an error!

If you've got:
[TRT]  building CUDA engine
Then all is good - just wait a few minutes for it to complete and then the camera should activate.

Now find / borrow a dog and test for bounding boxes! :)
